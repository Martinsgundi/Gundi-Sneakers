## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - UI library
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool


### What I learned

1. useRef: This React hook allows for DOM manipulations and lets you persist values between renders without causing a re-render. I utilized it to manage the visibility of the cartBox across components, enhancing the user experience.

2. createContext & useContext: These React hooks facilitate the sharing of values between components without prop drilling. They helped organize my states and props, maintaining clean and efficient code.

3. Touch Events: This project marked my first experience with touch events. I implemented onTouchStart, onTouchMove, and onTouchEnd to enable image swiping on mobile screens.

4. Math.abs: This function returns the absolute value of a number. It was essential for accurately calculating swipe distances.

5. Early Return Statements: Previously unfamiliar with their benefits, I now appreciate how early return statements allow for early condition checks and function exits. This practice helps avoid executing unnecessary logic.

6. Toast Notifications: Always admired, I implemented Toast notifications using the Toastify React library. These brief messages provide user feedback in an engaging manner.


### Continued development

I am enthusiastic about advancing my journey through building projects with complex functionalities and logic. This approach not only reinforces my existing skills but also provides opportunities to tackle and solve challenging problems. I am particularly eager to explore and implement innovative solutions, continually enhancing my learning experience and honing my problem-solving abilities
